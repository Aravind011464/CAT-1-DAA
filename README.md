# CAT-1-DAA

To find the shortest path of a graph using the following algorithms:

i)   Dijkstra's Algorithm

ii)  Prims's Algorithm

iii) Kruskal's Algorithm

I have chosen C++ beacause it has many in-built function and data structures like priority queue,stacks,etc.
It would be easier to implement graphs in C++.
